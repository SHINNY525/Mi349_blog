            <h2>Nostalgia from High School Soccer</h2>
            <h3>Published: 10/13 by Shion Lovelace</h3>
            <p>Fall... Around this time, there is a special place in my heart where I remember the good old days of the high school soccer season. I imagine myself and the team playing on the pitch. We were laughing whenever things turned out well, sometimes frustrated when it didn't. We got through many tough times together and were like a family. I still to this day recall the memories I made during the four years of high school and its seasons. I can't believe that this was nearly three years ago. Actually, my soccer career started way back, but that's another story. There are too many favorite moments throughout the four years, and it's so hard to choose one. If I really had to choose one moment, it would be the district finals. This game is so important since it gives you the ticket to the round of 16 of the State of Michgan High School Tournament. Our school was in division 1 which made each game we faced a hard hurdle to jump. All we did was run as hard as we can and chase that ball so that we can strike it in the net. I barely had time to take a breath, but at the end it was all worth the struggle. We won the game. What's even better is that we were able to win district finals two years in a row, when I was a junior and a senior. I made a lot of memories and also learned many things. What I wanted to say this whole time is, 'life is full of obstacles, but in the end have fun.'</p>

            <h2>Why and How To be in Shape</h2>
            <h3>Published: 10/13 by Shion Lovelace</h3>
            <p>Exercise is a very common way to be in shape. Health matters for everyone or at least for me, because I used to be a sports player myself. However, I don't do as much exercise as I used to before coming to college. Some reasons why you should be in shape is so that you can be healthy, helps mentally, and it can connect you to different people and even communities. But it's really hard now a days because we got a lot of things going on in life. So what can you do? I think taking 30 minutes of your day to do some type of exercise is enough. You might think that 30 minutes per day isn't very effective which I also thought before, but my mind completely changed since I started taking my time to actually exercise each day. To get straight to the point, it's harder than you think. You feel like you want to skip the day, every once in a while. That is why I like to play sports with my friends. We recently have been playing pickle ball and this also connected us to the pickle ball community. I love sports because the way it connects us to different people is just amazing. Being in shape is very important and you should keep in mind of your health too.</p>
